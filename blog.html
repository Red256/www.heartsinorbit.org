              <h2>First Post</h2>
              <p>Speaking as a musician of over a decade, the world of space belongs wholeheartedly in the universe of music. Music permeates every facet of our lives. Songs on the radio revitalize your dry drive to school or work. I hype myself up with Aespa’s Supernova. I sing along happily to Fitzgerald’s How High the Moon, and Debussy’s Au Clair de Lune — I’m sure you also do too. But what you might not pay attention to is that those songs are all brilliant mergers of astronomy and music, in academic, emotional, and musical fields.

Celestial bodies are light-years away, and yet their existence is referenced in all of human life. The newly emerging lyrics in pop music are poetic masterpieces.

“I’m like some kind of supernova, watch out.” - Aespa’s Supernova

A supernova is the greatest explosion known to man, of a massive star or white dwarf. We never encounter this sort of event in our daily lives, but Aespa connects this celestial explosion with human confidence. The special ways in which astronomy and music communicate emotion in ways that pure language cannot (Izen et al., 2023). Sarah C. Izen holds a Ph.D. as a cognitive neuroscientist, compiling a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10368476">literature review</a> with all sorts of information on the benefits of music, or “organized sound”. Music is universal, communicating similar emotions to everyone around the world, with simple waves of sound. Musicians and their audience align their brains when performing a tune. This can be achieved through conversation, but it is much more difficult to reach that same level of immersive human connection. Music has been known to exist as a paradigm for human communication. Music therapy also provides both cognitive and behavioral benefits for all sorts of individuals. Memory, social connection, and communication in interpersonal relationships are all benefited throughout the process of music therapy.

“Fly me to the moon, and let me play among the stars.” - Frank Sinatra’s Fly Me to the Moon

Can you define exactly what Sinatra conveys with those lyrics, without mentioning celestial objects? It’s immensely arduous. The moon and stars have certain qualities and denotations tied to them, each uniquely communicating different emotions. NASA has curated sonifications of galaxies, clusters, and nebulae, collectively known as <a href="https://chandra.si.edu/sound/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">A Universe of Sound.</a> The waves and distortions that the cosmos creates are transferred into pitch and frequency to make music.

But the sound of silence is also one to be cherished, a sort of music in itself. When you think of the cosmos, you think of nothingness. You may find it comforting, eerie, or fascinating. Nothingness brings things that are something in a sense. Nothingness brings emotion from us, whether visual or auditory.

The next time you tune in to the radio, scroll on Instagram, or open Spotify, you can take a moment to appreciate the intersection of astronomy and music.
