              <h2>Astronomy and Music Change Lives</h2>
              <h3>By Sarah Lin</h3>
              <p>Speaking as a musician of over a decade, the world of space belongs wholeheartedly in the universe of music. Music permeates every facet of our lives. Songs on the radio revitalize your dry drive to school or work. I hype myself up with Aespa’s Supernova. I sing along happily to Fitzgerald’s How High the Moon, and Debussy’s Au Clair de Lune — I’m sure you also do too. But what you might not pay attention to is that those songs are all brilliant mergers of astronomy and music, in academic, emotional, and musical fields.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Celestial bodies are light-years away, and yet their existence is referenced in all of human life. The newly emerging lyrics in pop music are poetic masterpieces.</p>
              <br>
              <p>“I’m like some kind of supernova, watch out.” - Aespa’s Supernova</p>
              <br>
              <img src="assets/photos/Armageddon_Digital_Cover.png" alt="Armageddon Digital Album Cover">
              <h3>Armageddon Cover, Aespa</h3>
              <br>
              <p>A supernova is the greatest explosion known to man, of a massive star or white dwarf. We never encounter this sort of event in our daily lives, but Aespa connects this celestial explosion with human confidence. The special ways in which astronomy and music communicate emotion in ways that pure language cannot (Izen et al., 2023). Sarah C. Izen holds a Ph.D. as a cognitive neuroscientist, compiling a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10368476">literature review</a> with all sorts of information on the benefits of music, or “organized sound”. Music is universal, communicating similar emotions to everyone around the world, with simple waves of sound. Musicians and their audience align their brains when performing a tune. This can be achieved through conversation, but it is much more difficult to reach that same level of immersive human connection. Music has been known to exist as a paradigm for human communication. Music therapy also provides both cognitive and behavioral benefits for all sorts of individuals. Memory, social connection, and communication in interpersonal relationships are all benefited throughout the process of music therapy.</p>

              <p>“Fly me to the moon, and let me play among the stars.” - Frank Sinatra’s Fly Me to the Moon</p>

              <h3>Fly Me to the Moon (Remastered), Frank Sinatra</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Can you define exactly what Sinatra conveys with those lyrics, without mentioning celestial objects? It’s immensely arduous. The moon and stars have certain qualities and denotations tied to them, each uniquely communicating different emotions. NASA has curated sonifications of galaxies, clusters, and nebulae, collectively known as <a href="https://chandra.si.edu/sound/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">A Universe of Sound.</a> The waves and distortions that the cosmos creates are transferred into pitch and frequency to make music.</p>
              <br>
              <p>But the sound of silence is also one to be cherished, a sort of music in itself. When you think of the cosmos, you think of nothingness. You may find it comforting, eerie, or fascinating. Nothingness brings things that are something in a sense. Nothingness brings emotion from us, whether visual or auditory.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The next time you tune in to the radio, scroll on Instagram, or open Spotify, you can take a moment to appreciate the intersection of astronomy and music.</p>

              <h2>Jazz Improvisation for the Soul and Mind</h2>
              <h3>By Sarah Lin</h3>
              <p><a href="https://youtu.be/KwIC6B_dvW4">Giant Steps.</a> Life sounds as dastardly beautiful as John Coltrane’s masterpiece of the hardest jazz standard known to man. His solo on the 1960 album holds such profound merit that to this day, musicians still play the transcribed solo in honor of Coltrane’s ingenuity. The beauty of improvisation touches the soul, as well as the mind.</p>

              <br>
              <p>In various aspects of life, jazz improvisation allows you to be younger. It’s hip! We are born improvisers in life — being able to let loose and freely express yourself through music transports you back to your childhood. To play and experiment without fear is a joy to be cherished. The benefits are not solely emotional: they blend into other facets of life. It has been shown that the positive effects of jazz improvisation are brain plasticity, divergent thinking, and the ability to address negative events or information (Vergara et al., 2021). These effects are typically achieved through clinical settings, but music acts as an alternative method. It reshapes your brain to grow and to explore the elements of creativity. In some cases, it can even aid in health conditions such as labile hypertension, allowing patients to manage their blood pressure spikes. Musical improvisation facilitates the development of various skills that may resonate more effectively with people, serving as an alternative to meditation or other clinical methods (Azzara et al., 2009).</p>
              <br>
              <p>The essence of finding your style in jazz is to listen. New players often start with the greats: Oscar Peterson, Buddy Rich, and Miles Davis, to name a few. Through the process of inspiration and experimentation, one finds their identity. You may like Count Basie, then decide you want a more complex style and jump to Charlie Parker. Like the shape of each person’s ears, every player’s improvisation is unique. The choice of pitches, rhythmic patterns, and even how much silence a performer leaves reveals their personality. The rhythmic quality of your improvisation, in particular, has been shown to identify a musician’s inspiration (Cheston et al., 2024). Do you like simplicity? <a href="https://youtu.be/NldPFVKYmiw">Frank Sinatra.</a> Funk and dissonance? <a href="https://youtu.be/GCojYqIpCwM">Thelonious Monk.</a> Jazz fusion? <a href="https://youtu.be/Iq7eMCV9Il0">Chick Corea.</a> In that last recording, the audience cues in on Corea’s improvised lines, responding in song. It’s the epitome of the universal beauty that jazz can create.</p>

              <br>
              <p>I have been a musician for nearly ten years. I went along with the natural progression of Asian parenting — to play classical piano as a fun party trick — to restrict myself to only the notes on the page. And for eight years, I did abide by those rules, gladly playing Mozart and Bach, sometimes enjoying it, other times crying in front of the keys. When I began first grade, I loved jazz, but until eighth grade, I had not even begun to explore the possibility of Jazz. Such a mystifying genre it was. Musical improvisation changed my personality as a whole, inspiring confidence in the areas where I had not fathomed I could change. Through the two years of high school, jazz has become a necessity in life, a moment of freedom, and an expression of the self. When being freed of the traditional classical realm, I had experienced joy unlike any other — like a newborn taking its first steps. Like any skill, it was frustrating at the start, but now it’s given way to the heart. Through my improvisation today, I play what my younger self would have aspired to become.</p>
