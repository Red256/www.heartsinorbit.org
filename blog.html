              <h2>Astronomy and Music Change Lives</h2>
              <h3>By Sarah Lin</h3>
              <p>Speaking as a musician of over a decade, the world of space belongs wholeheartedly in the universe of music. Music permeates every facet of our lives. Songs on the radio revitalize your dry drive to school or work. I hype myself up with Aespa's Supernova. I sing along happily to Fitzgerald's How High the Moon, and Debussy's Au Clair de Lune — I'm sure you also do too. But what you might not pay attention to is that those songs are all brilliant mergers of astronomy and music, in academic, emotional, and musical fields.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Celestial bodies are light-years away, and yet their existence is referenced in all of human life. The newly emerging lyrics in pop music are poetic masterpieces.</p>
              <br>
              <p>"I'm like some kind of supernova, watch out." - Aespa's Supernova</p>
              <br>
              <img src="assets/photos/Armageddon_Digital_Cover.png" alt="Armageddon Digital Album Cover">
              <h4>Armageddon Cover, Aespa</h4>
              <br>
              <p>A supernova is the greatest explosion known to man, of a massive star or white dwarf. We never encounter this sort of event in our daily lives, but Aespa connects this celestial explosion with human confidence. The special ways in which astronomy and music communicate emotion in ways that pure language cannot (Izen et al., 2023). Sarah C. Izen holds a Ph.D. as a cognitive neuroscientist, compiling a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10368476">literature review</a> with all sorts of information on the benefits of music, or "organized sound". Music is universal, communicating similar emotions to everyone around the world, with simple waves of sound. Musicians and their audience align their brains when performing a tune. This can be achieved through conversation, but it is much more difficult to reach that same level of immersive human connection. Music has been known to exist as a paradigm for human communication. Music therapy also provides both cognitive and behavioral benefits for all sorts of individuals. Memory, social connection, and communication in interpersonal relationships are all benefited throughout the process of music therapy.</p>
              <br>
              <p>"Fly me to the moon, and let me play among the stars." - Frank Sinatra's Fly Me to the Moon</p>
              <br>
              <img src="assets/photos/fly me to the moon.jpg" alt="Fly Me to the Moon Album Cover">
              <h4>Fly Me to the Moon (Remastered), Frank Sinatra</h4>
              <br>
              <p>Can you define exactly what Sinatra conveys with those lyrics, without mentioning celestial objects? It's immensely arduous. The moon and stars have certain qualities and denotations tied to them, each uniquely communicating different emotions. NASA has curated sonifications of galaxies, clusters, and nebulae, collectively known as <a href="https://chandra.si.edu/sound/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">A Universe of Sound.</a> The waves and distortions that the cosmos creates are transferred into pitch and frequency to make music.</p>
              <br>
              <p>But the sound of silence is also one to be cherished, a sort of music in itself. When you think of the cosmos, you think of nothingness. You may find it comforting, eerie, or fascinating. Nothingness brings things that are something in a sense. Nothingness brings emotion from us, whether visual or auditory.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The next time you tune in to the radio, scroll on Instagram, or open Spotify, you can take a moment to appreciate the intersection of astronomy and music.</p>

              <h2>Jazz Improvisation for the Soul and Mind</h2>
              <h3>By Sarah Lin</h3>
              <p><a href="https://youtu.be/KwIC6B_dvW4">Giant Steps.</a> Life sounds as dastardly beautiful as John Coltrane's masterpiece of the hardest jazz standard known to man. His solo on the 1960 album holds such profound merit that to this day, musicians still play the transcribed solo in honor of Coltrane's ingenuity. The beauty of improvisation touches the soul, as well as the mind.</p>
              <br>
              <img src="assets/photos/Coltrane_Giant_Steps.jpg" alt="Giant Steps Album Cover">
              <h4>Giant Steps, John Coltrane</h4>
              <br>
              <p>In various aspects of life, jazz improvisation allows you to be younger. It's hip! We are born improvisers in life — being able to let loose and freely express yourself through music transports you back to your childhood. To play and experiment without fear is a joy to be cherished. The benefits are not solely emotional: they blend into other facets of life. It has been shown that the positive effects of jazz improvisation are brain plasticity, divergent thinking, and the ability to address negative events or information (Vergara et al., 2021). These effects are typically achieved through clinical settings, but music acts as an alternative method. It reshapes your brain to grow and to explore the elements of creativity. In some cases, it can even aid in health conditions such as labile hypertension, allowing patients to manage their blood pressure spikes. Musical improvisation facilitates the development of various skills that may resonate more effectively with people, serving as an alternative to meditation or other clinical methods (Azzara et al., 2009).</p>
              <br>
              <p>The essence of finding your style in jazz is to listen. New players often start with the greats: Oscar Peterson, Buddy Rich, and Miles Davis, to name a few. Through the process of inspiration and experimentation, one finds their identity. You may like Count Basie, then decide you want a more complex style and jump to Charlie Parker. Like the shape of each person's ears, every player's improvisation is unique. The choice of pitches, rhythmic patterns, and even how much silence a performer leaves reveals their personality. The rhythmic quality of your improvisation, in particular, has been shown to identify a musician's inspiration (Cheston et al., 2024). Do you like simplicity? <a href="https://youtu.be/NldPFVKYmiw">Frank Sinatra.</a> Funk and dissonance? <a href="https://youtu.be/GCojYqIpCwM">Thelonious Monk.</a> Jazz fusion? <a href="https://youtu.be/Iq7eMCV9Il0">Chick Corea.</a> In that last recording, the audience cues in on Corea's improvised lines, responding in song. It's the epitome of the universal beauty that jazz can create.</p>
              <br>
              <img src="assets/photos/chick-corea-tokyo-jazz-fest.jpg" alt="Live at the Tokyo Jazz Festival, Chick Corea">
              <h4>Spain live at the Tokyo Jazz Festival, Chick Corea</h4>
              <br>
              <p>I have been a musician for nearly ten years. I went along with the natural progression of Asian parenting — to play classical piano as a fun party trick — to restrict myself to only the notes on the page. And for eight years, I did abide by those rules, gladly playing Mozart and Bach, sometimes enjoying it, other times crying in front of the keys. When I began first grade, I loved jazz, but until eighth grade, I had not even begun to explore the possibility of Jazz. Such a mystifying genre it was. Musical improvisation changed my personality as a whole, inspiring confidence in the areas where I had not fathomed I could change. Through the two years of high school, jazz has become a necessity in life, a moment of freedom, and an expression of the self. When being freed of the traditional classical realm, I had experienced joy unlike any other — like a newborn taking its first steps. Like any skill, it was frustrating at the start, but now it's given way to the heart. Through my improvisation today, I play what my younger self would have aspired to become.</p>

              <h2>Music Therapy for Dementia</h2>
              <h3>By Lacole Yang</h3>
              <p>Music's ability to evoke emotion and memory have led to its use with patients of Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's is a form of dementia. Characterized by memory loss and confusion, Alzheimer's patients might also experience problems thinking or understanding others, difficulty concentrating, inability to recognize objects or do math, aggression, personality changes, aggression, mood swings, loneliness, depression, or paranoia. Alzheimer's typically starts in the entorhinal complex near the hippocampus, a part of the brain that's crucial for memory formation and storage, and progresses to the brain stem. Musical treatment has been used to address Alzheimer's symptoms, particularly those related to mood and memory issues by bringing to mind memories associated with a certain music.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Music therapy can lessen agitation and improve social communication, as asserted by studies from Northwestern University. Music can be effective for calming Alzheimer's patients and redirecting your attention, especially if the music is from the time when they were teenagers or in their early 20's. The familiar nature of this music can be comforting and familiar. Music can also encourage mental stimulation with activities like tapping along with the rhythm, humming along or singing, and dancing. Music can also be distressing to patients– in this case, it's best to turn off the song and reassure the individual.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Music therapy can be done in various situations and settings, either with a professional music therapist or with a family member or loved one. Its format is flexible, as its inclusion in treatment can mean listening along with headphones, being part of a choir, playing instruments, or going to a concert. Music is a deceptively simple yet effective way to offer Alzheimer's patients comfort and familiarity.</p>

              <h2>Musical Epilepsy</h2>
              <h3>By Lacole Yang</h3>
              <p>In 2005, a woman seeks treatment for her convulsive seizures. Whenever she heard a particular genre of Italian folk songs, she would fall unconscious into a seizure or have a confusing change in her perception where she replayed old memories or imaginary moments. After undergoing a surgery in her temporal lobe, a part of her brain that showed some defects, she stopped having both seizures and bad reactions to music. This patient was cured of musical epilepsy (or musicogenic epilepsy), a form of epilepsy caused by hearing music.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Musical epilepsy is a rare form of epilepsy. It's estimated to appear in only 1 out of 10 million people. The type of music that triggers seizures often has emotional relevance to the patient. The music genre varies between patients; some people will be triggered by classic music, others will respond to Frank Sinatra, and another person might be affected by notes of a specific pitch. Specific frequencies and instruments within the music seem to be relevant.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Musicogenic seizures typically start in the temporal lobe. The temporal lobe is one of the four main lobes of the brain, and it is responsible for processing many sensory inputs, like sound, vision, and language. The temporal lobe also helps with memory and recognizing objects. When this brain area is given epileptic surgery, the condition is usually successfully treated.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In a world where we are constantly surrounded by music in our headphones, grocery stores, and waiting rooms, it must be difficult and frustrating to avoid a musical trigger. Although there's not much known about this condition, possibly because it is so rare, perhaps improved technology will let us study the mechanisms of musical epilepsy in greater precision. </p>

              <h2>The impact that different frequencies have on the human body–specifically astronauts'</h2>
              <h3>By Ginger Lai</h3>
              <p>Astronauts' bodies undergo lots of physical and mental change. To combat the side effects of the journey such as cerebrospinal spinal fluid altercations and short-term cognitive problems (not being able to retain any short-term memory post exploration), sound frequencies are brought into the rehabilitation process to aid in a steady recovery. It has been shown that promoting the glymphatic system aids in the recovery of astronauts experienced or not. Frequencies as low as 40 Hz promoted the stimulation of cerebrospinal fluid and neural activity to multiple brain regions which help realign their metabolic waste back to earth's gravity. Astronauts would incorporate more physical therapy to aid in other more physical changes such as bone density osteopenia from their flight in space. </p>
              <br>
              <p>Fun Fact: Astronauts are more likely at risk for developing Alzheimer's (the exact reason is not sure) but listening to music at 40Hz would help combat Alzheimer's as it activates many brain regions.</p>

              <h2>The Effects of Music on Isolation</h2>
              <h3>By Richard Hao</h3>
              <p>Music has been shown to reduce the negative effects of isolation, as it helps support emotional wellbeing and improves social connections. Research has shown that listening to music can release certain pathways in the brain, which then releases dopamine and reduces the stress hormone cortisol. This then alleviates many negative emotions associated with loneliness. Music can also help create bonds between people, whether that be through shared playlists or even creating music together, the people involved will be more socially inclined. Even when alone, people can still reduce their feelings of loneliness when listening to music, especially when the listeners feel understood by the artist when listening to them. Overall, music can function as not just an emotional regulator but as a tool to counteract the cognitive and emotional consequences of social isolation. </p>

              <br>
              <p>Music is able to significantly influence memory by engaging multiple parts of the brain. Research has shown that listening to music can activate areas of the brain such as the hippocampus and the cerebellum, which are regions of the brain that are critical for memory formation. This activation of the hippocampus and the cerebellum strengthens neural pathways, which could lead to improved memory. Music's emotional, melodic, and rhythmic qualities can also act as cues for  autobiographical memory, which is a person's memory of their life experiences.This is due to the strong connection between the brain's emotional centers, like the amygdala. The use of music in educational settings and therapy, particularly for conditions like dementia, showcases its potential as a tool for cognitive enhancement and memory preservation. However, the impact of music on memory can vary depending on factors such as the complexity of the task, the listener's familiarity with the music, and whether the music contains distracting elements like lyrics. </p>

              <h2>Effects of Space on the Human Body</h2>
              <h3>By Sarah Yin</h3>
              <p>Becoming an astronaut is one of the most common childhood dreams, and it's easy to see why: travelling to space seems like a dream adventure into the realm of wonder and the unknown. It is easy to forget the immense toll that space conditions would take. In reality, the journey is as demanding as it is wondrous. Spaceflight challenges nearly every system we rely on for balance, movement, and long-term health. Understanding the impact of space on the human body is essential for the safety and well-being of astronauts, especially in the future as destinations move from the International Space Station to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. </p>
              <br>
              <img src="assets/photos/isolation.webp" alt="">
              <br>
              <p><strong>Gravity Transitions and Motion Sickness</strong></p>
              <p>Transitioning from one gravity field to another is much more complex than it seems. Astronauts often face difficulties with spatial orientation, head-eye and hand-eye coordination, balance, and locomotion. Many even experience space motion sickness during the first few days in orbit, marked by nausea, dizziness, and disorientation. NASA conducts functional task and fine motor skill testing to ensure the safety of its astronauts after such shifts.</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Muscles and Bones in Microgravity</strong></p>
              <p>In the absence of gravity, the body doesn't need to support its own weight, which, over extended periods of time, causes muscle atrophy and bone loss. Studies show muscle mass can decrease by up to 20% in just 5–11 days in space. Additionally, without regular exercise, astronauts lose about 1% of their bone density every month. To combat this, astronauts adhere to rigorous routines, with at least 2 hours of daily resistance and aerobic exercise, using devices like the Resistive Exercise Device (aRED) and specialized treadmills. NASA has also tested medications such as bisphosphonates, which has shown effectiveness in preventing bone loss. Bone breakdown can also increase the risk of kidney stones due to calcium excretion. To combat this, NASA is studying preventive measures like potassium citrate supplements, validated in bed-rest and in-flight studies. </p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Fluid Shifts and Vision Problems</strong></p>
              <p>Microgravity causes bodily fluids to shift upward toward the head, a phenomenon linked to Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome (SANS), characterized by optic disc swelling, flattened eyeballs, choroidal folds, and long-term vision problems like farsightedness.  As a countermeasure, astronauts may wear compression cuffs on their thighs to keep blood in the lower body and counteract these fluid shifts. Devices like lower-body negative pressure chambers can also help pull fluids back down.</p>
              <br>

              <br>
              <p><strong>Radiation Exposure</strong></p>
              <p>On Earth, we're protected by the magnetic field and atmosphere from the majority of particles that make up space radiation. In space, astronauts endure elevated radiation levels from trapped particles, solar flares, and cosmic rays. Radiation raises the risk of cancer and degenerative diseases. Shielding, real-time monitoring, and strict operational procedures are essential strategies for mitigating this problem.</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Sleep, Stress, and Mental Health</strong></p>
              <p>Quality sleep is critical for well-being, but it's disrupted in space by altered light cycles, confined quarters, noise, and stress. Disrupted circadian rhythms can affect mood, decision-making, and overall performance. Crew isolation and monotony can further amplify risks of cognitive issues, depression, and psychiatric disorders. NASA studies suggest smaller, more restricted environments pose higher psychological risks. To help counter this, researchers are exploring using virtual reality to simulate relaxing environments, as well as engaging activities like learning new skills and languages to maintain morale. </p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Immune System Changes</strong></p>
              <p>Spaceflight alters immune responses in ways scientists are still working to fully understand. While astronauts generally don't get sick upon returning to Earth, these changes may predispose them to autoimmune issues, where the body mistakenly attacks healthy tissues.</p>
