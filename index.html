            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>Hearts in Orbit is a youth-led initiative exploring how music can support
                mental wellness in the most extreme environments—from outer space to
                underserved communities on Earth.</p>
            <p>Through research and design, we’re developing customizable music-based tools
                that enhance emotional well-being, focus, and rest in isolated or high-stress
                conditions. Whether for astronauts on a Mars mission or children in hospitals,
                we believe music can heal, connect, and uplift—across any distance.</p>
