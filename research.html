                    <h3>Sonification</h3>
                    <p>Sonification is the transformation of astronomical data into sound or music.</p>
                    <p>Data from celestial bodies, like gravitational waves, are mapped and analyzed.</p>
                    <p>Brightness → loudness, frequency → pitch, temporal changes → rhythm or tempo, etc.</p>
                    <p>Use software (e.g. Python libraries, MIDI synthesizers, DAWs) to render sound based on the mappings</li>
                    <p>Adjust musical aspects (e.g. harmonic scales, instrument types) to enhance clarity, preserve scientific meaning, or convey emotion</p>
                    <p>Result is an audible representation of data that reveals patterns which might be hard to detect visually</p>

                    <h3>Asteroseismology</h3>
                    <p>Stars produce sound waves internally, caused by turbulent convection in their outer layers.</p>
                    <p>They expand and contract, creating different frequencies.</p>
                    <p>Large stars produce low frequencies, and small stars produce high frequencies.</p>
                    <p>The Doppler Effect measures shift in light wavelengths and can be applied to other scenarios as well. A real life example is the changing pitch of an ambulance siren as it moves past you.</p>
                    <p>Space telescopes, such as Kepler and TESS, measure brightness changes over time.</p>
                    <p>Asteroseismology allows for exoplanets to be characterized for habitality, star age, size, and mass. Planet detection is achieved through asteroseismology.</p>

                <div class="project-text">
                    <h3>Musical Impact</h3>
                    <p>Many musical compositions reference astronomy. Both classical music (not to be confused with the Classical era) and contemporary (pop) music often reference astronomical objects, whether they have lyrics or not.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the most famous example of a classical, non-lyrical piece, is 
                        The Planets by Holst. Each of the seven musical works utilize 
                        different moods to represent each planet. For example, 
                        <i>I. Mars, the Bringer of War</i> is in a fast march style, utilizing 
                        dissonance to signify the Roman god of war. In contrast, 
                        <i>II. Venus, the Bringer of Peace</i> utilizes a Dorian, 
                        calming musical mode. More examples of classical pieces 
                        referencing astronomy include Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, 
                        Debussy’s <i>Au Clair de Lune</i>, and Mozart’s Symphony No. 41 in C-Major <i>Jupiter</i>. 
                        Antonin Dvorak’s <i>Song to the Moon</i> characterizes the moon as a being who can see all 
                        and is seen by all.</p>
                    <p>Pop music examples introduce the greater usage of songwriting with lyrics. Examples include Danny Elfman’s “Moon Dance”, Don M’s “Cassini’s Theme”, David Bowie’s “Life On Mars”, and Soundgarden’s “Black Hole Sun”. Each work interprets celestial objects in different ways, some using light bells, quietly plucked strings, while others use power chords and strong music. Many of the lyrics within use astronomical metaphor and setting, but do not tend to lean into the scientific aspect of astronomy. a-ha’s “White Dwarf” is a unique piece in which H-R diagrams are referenced.</p>
                    <p>AstroCapella is described as “a marriage of astronomy and music, developed by astronomers and educators and professionally recorded by the ‘rocking’ a cappella group The Chromatics”. The group demonstrates the possibility of merging both the science of astronomy and emotion into song.</p>
                    <p>Poetry prevails in the world of astronomy and music. Utilizing astronomical objects in a song is like an inspirational tool, to project the songwriter’s emotions in a more effective way. Astronomical metaphor and setting mostly serves as a tool for emotion, but can also demonstrate the scientific field of astronomy. Pop music demonstrates the possibility of merging both the science of astronomy and emotion into song.</p>
