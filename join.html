                    <ul>
                        <Li><p>Hearts in Orbit addresses the global need for accessible, scalable, and non-pharmacological mental health solutions in high-stress or underserved environments. These include emotional isolation and cognitive fatigue faced by astronauts on long-duration missions; loneliness, memory decline, and stress among seniors and hospitalized children; and lack of affordable mental wellness tools in low-resource communities.</p></Li>
                        <Li><p>Members have the chance to build leadership skills while they lead teams, manage timelines, speak at events, contribute to real research, and collaborate with professionals. These experiences support growth in communication, problem-solving, and initiativeâ€”key leadership traits.</p></Li>
                        <Li><p>All active participants can earn certified community service or volunteer hours. We also offer recommendation letters and leadership opportunities based on performance.</p></Li>
